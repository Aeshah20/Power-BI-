Management staff can identify current patterns and errors in the data with the help of data visualization. 
Making sense of these patterns enables the management to focus on areas that show warning signs or progress.
Dashboard is a terrific way for visualizing data, because it offers decision-makers a broad overview of their most crucial KPIs. This report
